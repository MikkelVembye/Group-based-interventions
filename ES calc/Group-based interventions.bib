abstract = {Controlled trials have established the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for depression. However, the relative effectiveness of individual versus group treatment formats in real-world settings is less well established. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of group CBT (n=157) compared to individual CBT (n=77) for depressed outpatients in a naturalistic setting. Symptom improvements for depression, anxiety, and quality of life were compared between treatment formats in intent-to-treat and completer analyses. Effect sizes and rates of recovery were examined. Results showed that both individual and group CBT were effective, even in the presence of high levels of comorbidity. Whereas individual CBT was associated with larger effect sizes and significantly higher rates of recovery, group CBT compared favorably to outcomes established by past research. A broad-spectrum group CBT program may be a viable treatment option when depression symptoms are less severe and when this format of treatment delivery is desirable.},

abstract = {Background Emotional disorders are highly prevalent in primary care. We aimed to determine whether a transdiagnostic psychological therapy plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) is more efficacious than TAU alone in primary care adult patients.  Methods A randomized, two-arm, single-blind clinical trial was conducted in 22 primary care centres in Spain. A total of 1061 adult patients with emotional disorders were enrolled. The transdiagnostic protocol (n = 527) consisted of seven 90-min sessions (8–10 patients) delivered over a 12–14-week period. TAU (n = 534) consisted of regular consultations with a general practitioner. Primary outcome measures were self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatizations. Secondary outcome measures were functioning and quality of life. Patients were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed.  Results Post-treatment primary outcomes were significantly better in the transdiagnostic group compared to TAU (anxiety: p < 0.001; Morris's d = −0.65; depression: p < 0.001; d = −0.58, and somatic symptoms: p < 0.001; d = −0.40). These effects were sustained at the 12-month follow-up (anxiety: p < 0.001; d = −0.44; depression: p < 0.001; d = −0.36 and somatic symptoms: p < 0.001; d = −0.32). The transdiagnostic group also had significantly better outcomes on functioning (d = 0.16–0.33) and quality of life domains (d = 0.24–0.42), with sustained improvement at the 12-month follow-up in functioning (d = 0.25–0.39) and quality of life (d = 0.58–0.72). Reliable recovery rates showed large between-group effect sizes (d > 0.80) in favour of the transdiagnostic group after treatment and at the 12-month follow-up.  Conclusions Adding a brief transdiagnostic psychological intervention to TAU may significantly improve outcomes in emotional disorders treated in primary care.

@article{Fisher1996,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The relative effectiveness of two types of group therapy-the disease-and-recovery model and the cognitive-behavioral model-was examined in a public inpatient and outpatient setting with consumers who had a dual diagnosis of a personality disorder and a substance use disorder. Outcomes in four areas of problem severity were measured: alcohol use, drug use, social and family relations, and psychological functioning. METHODS: Using a quasiexperimental group design, 19 subjects in an inpatient mental health facility and 19 in a public outpatient facility were randomly assigned to the two experimental groups. The groups met three times a week for 12 weeks, and specific group leadership protocols were used. A third group at each setting received usual group treatment. Diagnoses of all subjects were verified using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. The Addiction Severity Index measured changes in problem severity. RESULTS: In the inpatient setting, subjects in both experimental groups had significantly improved social and family relations compared with the usual-treatment group; no posttest changes in the other three areas were noted. In the outpatient setting, cognitive-behavioral group therapy was significantly more effective than the other two group approaches in reducing alcohol use, improving social and family relations, and enhancing psychological functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the severity of mental health consumers' substance abuse problems can be substantially decreased in several areas in an outpatient public setting. In an inpatient setting, the use of either group therapy model was more effective in reducing problem severity than using no specific model.},

@article{Wuthrich2013,
abstract = {Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid in older adults and are associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes and poorer response to psychological and pharmacological treatments. However, little research has examined the effectiveness of psychological programs to treat comorbid anxiety and depression in older adults. Sixty-two community dwelling adults aged over 60 years with comorbid anxiety and depression were randomly allocated to group cognitive behavioural therapy or a waitlist condition and were assessed immediately following and three months after treatment. After controlling for cognitive ability at pre-treatment, cognitive behaviour therapy resulted in significantly greater reductions, than waitlist, on symptoms of anxiety and depression based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview rated by clinicians unaware of treatment condition. Significant time by treatment interactions were also found for self-report measures of anxiety and depression and these gains were maintained at the three month follow up period. In contrast no significant differences were found between groups on measures of worry and well-being. In conclusion, group cognitive behavioural therapy is efficacious in reducing comorbid anxiety and depression in geriatric populations and gains maintain for at least three months.},

@article{Hedges2015_onetreatcluster,
abstract = {Some experimental designs involve clustering within only one treatment group. Such designs may involve group tutoring, therapy administered by multiple therapists, or interventions administered by clinics for the treatment group, whereas the control group receives no treatment. In such cases, the data analysis often proceeds as if there were no clustering within the treatment group. A consequence is that the actual significance level of the treatment effects is larger (i.e., actual p values are larger) than nominal. Additionally, biases will be introduced in estimates of the effect sizes and their variances, leading to inflated effects and underestimated variances when clustering in the treatment group is not taken into account. These consequences of clustering can seriously compromise the interpretation of study results. This article shows how information on the intraclass correlation can be used to obtain a correction for biases in the effect sizes and their variances, and also to obtain an adjustment to the significance test for the effects of clustering.},

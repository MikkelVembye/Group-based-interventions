abstract = {This article presents methods for using extant data to improve the properties of estimators of the standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size. Because samples recruited into education research studies are often more homogeneous than the populations of policy interest, the variation in educational outcomes can be smaller in these samples than is reflective of the true variation in the population. This affects effect size estimation since the sample standard deviation is used in the denominator of the SMD. We propose leveraging extant data on sample variance estimates from multiple studies, made available via clearinghouse databases such as the What Works Clearinghouse, to standardize a mean difference. This allows effect sizes to be benchmarked across a common and broad population, thus enabling better comparability across studies and interventions. We derive the new estimators of the population variance and the corresponding SMD, which pool sample variances from multiple studies using both an analysis of variance and a meta-analytic framework. We demonstrate the properties of these estimators via analytic and simulation results and offer recommendations for when these estimators are appropriate in practice.},

abstract = {Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid in older adults and are associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes and poorer response to psychological and pharmacological treatments. However, little research has examined the effectiveness of psychological programs to treat comorbid anxiety and depression in older adults. Sixty-two community dwelling adults aged over 60 years with comorbid anxiety and depression were randomly allocated to group cognitive behavioural therapy or a waitlist condition and were assessed immediately following and three months after treatment. After controlling for cognitive ability at pre-treatment, cognitive behaviour therapy resulted in significantly greater reductions, than waitlist, on symptoms of anxiety and depression based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview rated by clinicians unaware of treatment condition. Significant time by treatment interactions were also found for self-report measures of anxiety and depression and these gains were maintained at the three month follow up period. In contrast no significant differences were found between groups on measures of worry and well-being. In conclusion, group cognitive behavioural therapy is efficacious in reducing comorbid anxiety and depression in geriatric populations and gains maintain for at least three months.},

Participants in this study were referred from either the psychiatric in- or outpatient clinic at the psychiatric university hospital in Trondheim, Norway. The patients were assessed with SCID I and SCID II, and randomized either to cognitive group therapy (n=15) or to a waiting list (n=17). Self-report assessments of symptoms and interpersonal difficulties were administered at the start of therapy, after termination of therapy (8 weeks), and at 6 months and 12 months follow-up. Thirty-two patients completed 8 weeks of therapy. Results showed that an 8-week program of CBGT performed better than the waiting list controls, on symptom relief at post-treatment for all patients. The effects of therapy were still upheld at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Cognitive therapy seems to be useful and effective in a group format in naturalistic clinical settings, with patients suffering from various forms of non-psychotic co-morbid psychiatric disorders.

abstract = {Background: In 2010, the Zentrum f{\"{u}}r seelische Gesundheit Leopoldau was established as the first institution for medical rehabilitation of mental disorders with outpatient care in Austria. Until 2013, the rehabilitation center was run as a pilot project in cooperation with the Austrian Pensionsversicherungsanstalt (Pension Insurance Institution) and thoroughly evaluated. The 6‐week multimodal rehabilitation program is based on cognitive behavioral and disorder‐specific therapy. Using a waiting list control group study design, an additional measurement of treatment efficacy will be performed. Patients and Methods: From October 2010 until December 2013, a total of 2,365 patients made use of a rehabilitation treatment und filled out questionnaire‐based surveys at 3 time points: 1) at the time of pre‐contact (screening interview) before starting rehabilitation, 2) at admission, and 3) at the time of discharge. The study includes all patients having waited between 42 and 48 days to start their rehabilitation treatment (n = 170), resulting in comparable waiting times and 6‐week treatment times for all patients included in the study. A randomized selection of 170 patients from the remaining sample (2,195 patients) was chosen as intervention group. The general symptomatology was examined applying the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), depression via the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and quality of life via the WHO Quality of Life‐BREF (WHOQOL‐BREF). Results: Significant improvements with regard to the general symptomatology, depressive symptoms, and quality of life were shown when comparing the waiting list control group and the intervention group, as well as within the intervention group. Discussion: The present study can be seen as the first controlled analysis to ascertain the effectiveness of a multimodal behavioral therapy‐based rehabilitation program. The results lead to the conclusion that this method results in a significant reduction of the symptomatology, which can be interpreted as confirmation of effectiveness.},

Method: The Integrative Outpatient Model (IOM) includes psychoeducation regarding illness, illness management, and exploration of dynamic and interpersonal issues. Results: At one-year follow up, group members had significantly less depressive symptomatology and were less likely to be in a mood episode, compared to controls. There were no between-group differences in manic symptoms or global assessments of functioning. For group-treated patients, the number of days well per week improved significantly; there were no significant improvements in the control group. Conclusions: This pilot study indicates that psychodynamic group psychotherapy is feasible as a component of treatment for bipolar disorder diagnoses. The results suggest benefits on depressive, but not manic symptoms. The 73 % retention rate suggests that further study of this treatment is warranted, especially in the cases of patients for whom pharmacotherapy alone is not sufficient.},

METHODS The authors evaluated a psychosocial intervention designed to improve everyday living skills of middle-aged and older outpatients with very chronic psychotic disorders (mean duration of illness: 21 years). Forty patients who resided in board-and-care facilities were randomly assigned to either a 24-session functional adaptation skills training (FAST) group therapy program targeting problem areas identified in previous work as being problematic for this population (e.g., using public transportation) or treatment-as-usual. Almost all the participants also received antipsychotics. RESULTS Compared with the patients randomized to the treatment-as-usual condition, FAST-treated patients' performance on everyday living skills improved significantly immediately post-intervention and was still significantly better at a 3-month maintenance follow-up period. There was no significant change in psychopathology. CONCLUSION Results suggest that older patients with longstanding psychotic disorders may benefit from participation in this skills-training program.},

abstract = {Young adults with personality disorders (PD) other than borderline are in urgent need of validated treatments to help them in managing important life transitions. Therapeutic interventions focused upon social and interpersonal difficulties may facilitate these individuals in maximizing opportunities for employment, forming stable romantic relationships, and belong to social groups. It is also important that they are offered evidence‐based, first‐line time‐limited treatments in order to maximize effectiveness and reduce costs. We developed a 16‐session programme of group‐based Metacognitive Interpersonal Therapy (MIT‐G) including psychoeducation on the main interpersonal motives, an experiential component enabling practice of awareness of mental states; and use of mentalistic knowledge for purposeful problem‐solving. We report a feasibility, acceptability, and clinical significance randomized clinical trial. Participants meeting inclusion criteria were randomized to receive MIT‐G (n = 10) or waiting list+TAU (n = 10). Dropout rate was low and session attendance high (92.19%). Participants in the MIT‐G arm had symptomatic and functional improvements consistent with large effect sizes. In the MIT‐G arm similarly large effects were noted for increased capacity to understand mental states and regulate social interactions using mentalistic knowledge. Results were sustained at follow‐up. Our findings suggest potential for applying MIT‐G in larger samples to further test its effectiveness in reducing PD‐related symptoms and problematic social functioning.},

Gastown Vocational Services (GVS) is a specialized vocational rehabilitation program, under the auspices of Greater Vancouver Mental Health Service Society. The project consisted of three distinct phases and utilized a gradual, step-by-step rehabilitative approach to achieve vocational success. The first phase of the GVS project included comprehensive vocational assessment and work-readiness skill training. Participants in this phase met in small groups for three hours, three times a week for a 12-week period. The second phase involved supported work-experience placements in the community. These placements were two to five months in duration. The final phase included assistance in seeking employment, job re-training, or educational programs. Assessment measures were taken before participants began the program, immediately after the 12-week job preparation program, and at six-month follow-up. Seventy-three individuals participated in the training program over a two-year period. Their progress was compared to 18 individuals comprising a Waiting List Control group. The results showed significant improvement in the Intervention group on measures of assertiveness, work behaviour, depression, income, and employment status. No changes were evident in the Waiting List Control group.},

abstract = {Objective: Loneliness is a key public health issue for which various interventions have been trialed. However, few directly target the core feature of loneliness—lack of belonging. This is the focus of Groups 4 Health (G4H), a recently developed intervention that targets the development and maintenance of social group memberships to support health. Method: To investigate the efficacy of this intervention, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants (N = 120) assigned to G4H or treatment-as-usual (TAU) by computer software. Assessment of primary (loneliness) and secondary (depression, social anxiety, general practitioner visits, multiple group membership) outcomes was conducted at baseline and 2-month follow-up using mixed-model repeated-measures analyses. Results: G4H produced a greater reduction in loneliness (d = −1.04) and social anxiety (d = −0.46) than TAU (d = −0.33 and d = 0.03, respectively). G4H was also associated with fewer general practitioner visits at follow-up (d = −0.33) and a stronger sense of belonging to multiple groups (d = 0.52) relative to TAU (d = 0.30 and d = 0.33, respectively). Depression declined significantly in both G4H (d = −0.63) and TAU (d = −0.34), but follow-up analyses showed this was greater in G4H among those not receiving adjunct psychopharmacological treatment and whose symptoms were milder. Conclusions: Findings suggest that G4H can be a useful way to treat loneliness and highlight the importance of attending to group memberships when tackling this important social challenge.

abstract = {Background and objectives: Schema group therapy is a potentially cost-effective treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). We piloted the feasibility and effectiveness of a 20-session schema group therapy without individual therapy among psychiatric BPD outpatients in a randomized pilot study registered as a clinical trial (ISRCTN76381242). Method(s): Altogether 42 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with BPD were randomized 2:1 to a 20-session weekly schema group therapy plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 28) vs. a control group with TAU alone (n = 14). The primary outcome was decline of BPD symptoms in the short Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23) score. Secondary outcomes were decline in symptoms of anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and improvement in functioning and schema modes. Two external experts evaluated validity of the intervention based on videotaped sessions. Result(s): Overall, 23 schema group therapy patients (82%) and 12 controls (86%) completed their treatment. Treatment validity good or very good. However, no significant differences emerged in the primary outcome mean BSL-23 decline (6.95 [SE 5.91] in group schema therapy vs. 12.55 [4.85] in TAU) or in any of the secondary outcome measures. Limitation(s): Despite randomization, the TAU subgroup had non-significantly higher baseline scores in most measures. Small sample size predisposing to type II errors; reliance on self-reported outcomes. Conclusion(s): Schema group therapy was feasible for psychiatric outpatients with BPD. However, in this small pilot study we did not find it more effective than TAU. Effectiveness of this short intervention remains open.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 The Author(s).

METHODS: A total of 63 outpatients, ages 18 to 45 years, with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenic disorders were randomly assigned to standard care or multiple-family group psychoeducation treatment at a large mental health center in Spokane, Washington. Treatment assignment was stratified by whether patients were taking typical or atypical antipsychotic medications. Negative symptom status was monitored monthly for one year by raters blind to group assignment and measured as a composite of five symptoms using the Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. RESULTS: When the analysis controlled for baseline negative symptoms, participants in the multiple-family group experienced significantly reduced negative symptoms compared with those receiving standard care. Taking atypical antipsychotic medication or having a diagnosis of substance abuse was not associated with the severity of negative symptoms. An additional analysis of the five individual negative symptoms indicated small but consistent group differences on all dimensions except inattention. Negative symptoms were significantly correlated with relapse to acute illness but not with outpatient or inpatient service use. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that a psychoeducational multiple-family group intervention was more effective than standard care in managing negative symptoms over a 12-month period. The results are particularly relevant because negative symptoms are associated with relapse, poor social and occupational functioning, cognitive impairment, and lower subjective quality of life.},

abstract = {There is evidence that Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp) is an effective intervention for reducing psychotic symptoms. The recently updated Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines (RANZCP CPG) recommend CBTp for the therapeutic management of schizophrenia and related disorders. Translational research is required to examine how well CBTp can be applied into public mental health services. This feasibility study aimed to provide preliminary evidence on how acceptable, implementable, and adaptable individual or group CBTp may be within a public mental health service in Australia. Twenty-seven participants initially agreed to participate in the study with 16 participants being randomised to either group or individual therapy, 11 starting therapy and 7 completing therapy. The intervention involved approximately 20 h of manualised CBTp. Attendance was higher in the individual therapy. Subjective reports indicated that the therapy was acceptable to all completers. Participants who engaged in individual or group CBTp experienced a similar level of reduction in the severity of hallucinations and delusions. Individual CBTp may be a feasible, acceptable, and effective intervention to include in Australian public mental health services. A pilot trial is now required to provide further evidence for and guidance of how best to translate CBTp protocols to Australian mental health services.},

abstract = {The stress associated with managing a first episode of schizophrenia and the secondary psychological sequelae may predispose young people to the phenomenon of illness engulfment, whereby personal identity is lost and replaced with a sense of self defined entirely by the illness. The overall objective of this pilot project was to provide an initial evaluation of the impact of a novel group intervention targeting improvement of self-concept (engulfment) and overall quality of life for young adults recovering from a first episode of schizophrenia. Fifty-two young adults diagnosed with a DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorder were sequentially assigned to either a 12-week group intervention that provided members with opportunities to attain healthy self-concepts or a control group that received high quality treatment as usual. The two groups were compared on pretreatment, post-treatment, and 3-month post-treatment measures of engulfment, quality of life, and psychiatric symptoms. Allowing for dropouts, 26 subjects remained in the treatment group and 14 subjects in the control group after the 3-month follow-up. Participants in the treatment group demonstrated significant improvement in engulfment, quality of life (intrapsychic subscale) and symptoms, while the comparison group did not change. These preliminary results provide support for the benefits of a group intervention designed to enhance self-concept and to minimize the engulfing effects of illness.

abstract = {Background: In this effectiveness trial we compared the long-term effects on hospitalizations of group psychoeducation (GP) versus individual psychoeducation (IP) for a heterogeneous sample of patients with BD recruited from general clinical settings.Methods: Eighty-five patients with BD were randomized to receive 10 weekly sessions of GP followed by 8 booster-sessions over the next two years, or three sessions of IP. Time to first admission over the course of GP was the primary outcome measure, with additional outcomes examining the use of psychiatric services over about 8 years.Results: Patients allocated to GP had longer survival time compared to IP over 27 months (p<0.05). There were also group differences in survival time over 8 years, but treatment allocation alone was no longer a significant predictor of survival time (p=0.07). There was an interaction between group (GP/IP) and harmful substance use (HSU), such that GP cases with comorbid HSU had the shortest survival time, whilst GP cases without HSU survived the longest (p=0.02). Also, GP cases had a small but significant reduction in hospital use compared with IP (p=0.04).Limitations: We did not have a 'pure' treatment as usual group. Wide confidence intervals for some of the odds ratios suggest that the findings need to be treated with some caution. Insufficient sample size for more detailed subgroup analyses.Conclusions: GP is superior to IP in delaying hospitalizations in a clinically representative population. However, GP did not prevent or delay admissions in BD patients with HSU.},

abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) adversely affects daily activities/functioning. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) assesses disability in work/school activities, family relationships, and social functioning, and it evaluates the functional impact of psychiatric disorders. BD outpatients from 21 U.S. sites completed a battery of validated instruments (including the SDS) three times over 8–12 weeks. Instrument reliability (internal consistency, test–retest), validity (construct, convergent validity, known groups) and responsiveness were measured. There were missing data for the SDS in 2% of the 225 subjects with BD. One factor explained 82% of the variance. All SDS items had rotated factor loadings on the first factor >0.90, confirming the appropriateness of the SDS total score. Item-scale correlations surpassed 0.40. There was excellent internal consistency reliability for the SDS total score (Cronbach's alpha=0.89). Test–retest reliability was acceptable for the SDS total score (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.73). Correlations with other instruments demonstrate convergent and divergent validity. The SDS total and item scores significantly discriminated between (self-rated) overall health status, clinician-rated functional status, and clinician-rated depression, evidencing known group validity. The SDS demonstrated ability to detect change over time. The SDS is a valid, reliable measure of disability and is responsive to change over time when used in subjects with BD.},

abstract = {Controlled trials have established the efficacy of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for depression. However, the relative effectiveness of individual versus group treatment formats in real-world settings is less well established. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of group CBT (n=157) compared to individual CBT (n=77) for depressed outpatients in a naturalistic setting. Symptom improvements for depression, anxiety, and quality of life were compared between treatment formats in intent-to-treat and completer analyses. Effect sizes and rates of recovery were examined. Results showed that both individual and group CBT were effective, even in the presence of high levels of comorbidity. Whereas individual CBT was associated with larger effect sizes and significantly higher rates of recovery, group CBT compared favorably to outcomes established by past research. A broad-spectrum group CBT program may be a viable treatment option when depression symptoms are less severe and when this format of treatment delivery is desirable.

abstract = {Background: Day-hospital-based treatment programmes have been recommended for poorly functioning patients with personality disorders (PD). However, more research is needed to confirm the cost-effectiveness of such extensive programmes over other, presumably simpler, treatment formats. Methods: This study compared health service costs and psychosocial functioning for PD patients randomly allocated to either a day-hospital-based treatment programme combining individual and group psychotherapy in a step-down format, or outpatient individual psychotherapy at a specialist practice. It included 107 PD patients, 46% of whom had borderline PD, and 40% of whom had avoidant PD. Costs included the two treatment conditions and additional primary and secondary in-and outpatient services. Psychosocial functioning was assessed using measures of global (observer-rated GAF) and occupational (self-report) functioning. Repeated assessments over three years were analysed using mixed models. Results: The costs of step-down treatment were higher than those of outpatient treatment, but these high costs were compensated by considerably lower costs of other health services. However, costs and clinical gains depended on the type of PD. For borderline PD patients, cost-effectiveness did not differ by treatment condition. Health service costs declined during the trial, and functioning improved to mild impairment levels (GAF > 60). For avoidant PD patients, considerable adjuvant health services expanded the outpatient format. Clinical improvements were nevertheless superior to the step-down condition. Conclusion: Our results indicate that decisions on treatment format should differentiate between PD types. For borderline PD patients, the costs and gains of step-down and outpatient treatment conditions did not differ. For avoidant PD patients, the outpatient format was a better alternative, leaning, however, on costly additional health services in the early phase of treatment.},

abstract = {Objectives Persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI) have elevated rates of comorbid medical conditions, but may also face challenges in effectively managing those conditions. Methods The study team developed and pilot-tested the Health and Recovery Program (HARP), an adaptation of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) for mental health consumers. A manualized, six-session intervention, delivered by mental health peer leaders, helps participants become more effective managers of their chronic illnesses. A pilot trial randomized 80 consumers with one or more chronic medical illness to either the HARP program or usual care. Results At six month follow-up, participants in the HARP program had a significantly greater improvement in patient activation than those in usual care (7.7% relative improvement vs. 5.7% decline, p=0.03 for group∗time interaction), and in rates of having one or more primary care visit (68.4% vs. 51.9% with one or more visit, p=0.046 for group∗time interaction). Intervention advantages were observed for physical health related quality of life (HRQOL), physical activity, medication adherence, and, and though not statistically significant, had similar effect sizes as those seen for the CDSMP in general medical populations. Improvements in HRQOL were largest among medically and socially vulnerable subpopulations. Conclusions This peer-led, medical self-management program was feasible and showed promise for improving a range of health outcomes among mental health consumers with chronic medical comorbidities. The HARP intervention may provide a vehicle for the mental health peer workforce to actively engage in efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality among mental health consumers.},

abstract = {Elevated internalized stigma is common and is linked to subjective and objective outcomes for severe mental illness. The authors developed a manualized group-based intervention (Narrative Enhancement/Cognitive Therapy; NECT) to address internalized stigma in severe mental illness. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of NECT. In total, 144 individuals were screened at two sites to evaluate if they met criteria for 'elevated' internalized stigma; 39 and were eligible were randomized to NECT or to treatment as usual (TAU) and were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Fifteen of the 21 individuals assigned to NECT were classified as 'exposed' to treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses found no significant difference between the NECT and TAU groups. A comparison of exposed versus unexposed participants noted trends for exposed participants to have improved more in two aspects of self-stigma as well as insight. We conclude that NECT is feasible and tolerable, but findings did not support the hypothesis that NECT was more effective than TAU, although small sample size and significant dropout may have restricted the ability to detect an effect.

abstract = {AIMS: Third‐wave psychological interventions have gained relevance in mental health service provision but their application to people with psychosis is in its infancy and interventions targeting wellbeing in psychosis are scarce. This study tested the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of positive psychotherapy adapted for people with psychosis (WELLFOCUS PPT) to improve wellbeing. METHODS: WELLFOCUS PPT was tested as an 11‐week group intervention in a convenience sample of people with psychosis in a single centre randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN04199273) involving 94 people with psychosis. Patients were individually randomised in blocks to receive either WELLFOCUS PPT in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), or TAU only. Assessments took place before randomisation and after the therapy. The primary outcome was wellbeing (Warwick‐Edinburgh Mental Well‐Being Scale, WEMWBS). Secondary outcomes included symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), depression (Short Depression‐Happiness Scale), self‐esteem, empowerment, hope, sense of coherence, savouring beliefs and functioning, as well as two alternative measures of wellbeing (the Positive Psychotherapy Inventory and Quality of Life). Intention‐to‐treat analysis was performed. This involved calculating crude changes and paired‐sample t‐tests for all variables, as well as ANCOVA and Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) Analysis to estimate the main effect of group on all outcomes. RESULTS: The intervention and trial procedures proved feasible and well accepted. Crude changes between baseline and follow‐up showed a significant improvement in the intervention group for wellbeing according to all three concepts assessed (i.e., WEMWBS, Positive Psychotherapy Inventory and Quality of Life), as well as for symptoms, depression, hope, self‐esteem and sense of coherence. No significant changes were observed in the control group. ANCOVA showed no main effect on wellbeing according to the primary outcome scale (WEMWBS) but significant effects on symptoms (p = 0.006, ES = 0.42), depression (p = 0.03, ES = 0.38) and wellbeing according to the Positive Psychotherapy Inventory (p = 0.02, ES = 0.30). Secondary analysis adapting for therapy group further improved the results for symptom reduction (p = 0.004, ES = 0.43) and depression (p = 0.03, ES = 0.41) but did not lead to any more outcomes falling below the p = 0.05 significance level. CACE analysis showed a non‐significant positive association between the intervention and WEMWBS scores at follow‐up (b = 0.21, z = 0.9, p = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence on the feasibility of WELLFOCUS PPT in people with psychosis, positively affecting symptoms and depression. However, more work is needed to optimise its effectiveness. Future research might evaluate positive psychotherapy as a treatment for comorbid depression in psychosis, and consider alternative measurements of wellbeing.},

abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling mental health condition. The early application of cognitive remediation interventions has provided some of the greatest hope of reducing long-term disability in the condition. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a particularly promising approach to cognitive remediation that integrates both computerbased neurocognitive training and structured social-cognitive groups. In 2009, Eack and colleagues demonstrated evidence that CET significantly improved cognitive and functional outcomes among individuals in the early course of schizophrenia (N = 58). The current study seeks to confirm these effects in the early course of the condition in a larger multi-site clinical trial. Method(s): A total of 106 (Pittsburgh: n = 54; Boston: n = 52) early course schizophrenia outpatients were randomized to either 18 months of CET (n = 61) or an Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST; n = 45) comparison treatment. Patients completed a comprehensive battery of cognitive, functional, and clinical assessments at baseline, 9 (mid-treatment), and 18 months (end of treatment). Composite indexes were calculated for neurocognition, social cognition, functional outcome, and symptomatology. Intent-to-treat linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for potential demographic and antipsychotic dose confounding effects, were used to investigate differential change trajectories in outcomes between CET and EST. The group (CET vs. EST) x time (baseline, 9, and 18 months) interaction was the effect of interest. Result(s): No significant group x time interactions were observed for either neurocognition (F2,88 = .30, p = .742) or clinical symptoms (F2,88 = .13, p = .874). CET demonstrated particularly favorable effects on social cognition and functional outcomes. Over the 18 months of treatment, relative to the patients in the EST treatment group, those in CET had significantly greater linear gains in social-cognitive abilities (F2,88 = 3.62, p = .031, d = .64) and functional outcome (F2,88 = 4.18, p = .019, d = .37). Discussion(s): These results support CET as an effective treatment for improving social cognitive and functional outcomes in the early course of schizophrenia, largely confirming the findings from the initial trial (Eack et al., 2009). Such evidence underscores the impact of CET on reducing disability when applied as an early course intervention.},

Few studies have identified interventions that reduce cannabis use and improve clinical outcome in this population.Aims: We undertook a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of a group psychological intervention for psychosis with comorbid cannabis dependence to determine whether there was any impact on cannabis use symptoms, global functioning, insight, attitudes to treatment and subjective quality of life.Method: Across three centers, we compared a group psychological intervention, based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing, with treatment as usual among patients experiencing their first psychotic episode or early in the course of psychotic illness.

However, the intervention improved subjective quality of life at 3months and this effect was sustained at 1year.Conclusions: Over the early phase of psychotic illness, group psychological interventions for those with comorbid cannabis dependence improved subjective quality of life. However, this was not associated with reduction in use of cannabis or improvement in clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUD) are associated with a more severe course and worse outcome than either disorder alone. In Europe, few treatments have been evaluated for PTSD and SUD. Seeking Safety, a manualized, integrated, cognitive-behavioural treatment, has been shown to be effective in studies in the USA. Objective: To test the efficacy of Seeking Safety plus treatment as usual (TAU) in female outpatients with PTSD and SUD compared to Relapse Prevention Training (RPT) plus TAU and TAU alone. Method: In five German study centres a total of N = 343 women were randomized into one of the three study conditions. PTSD severity (primary outcome), substance use, depression and emotion dysregulation (secondary outcomes) were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, as well as at three months and six months post-treatment. Results: Treatment participants attended M = 6.6 sessions (Seeking Safety) and M = 6.1 sessions (RPT). In an intent-to-treat analysis, Seeking Safety plus TAU, RPT plus TAU and TAU alone showed comparable decreases in PTSD severity over the course of the study. Seeking Safety plus TAU showed superior efficacy to TAU alone on depression and emotion regulation and RPT plus TAU was more effective than TAU alone on number of substance-free days and alcohol severity. Minimum-dose analyses suggest additional effects of both programmes among participants who attended at least eight group sessions. Conclusions: With respect to PTSD symptoms, a brief dose of Seeking Safety and RPT in addition to TAU was not superior to TAU alone in women with PTSD and SUD. However, Seeking Safety and RPT showed greater reductions than TAU alone in other domains of psychopathology and substance use outcomes respectively. Future studies should investigate further variables, such as what aspects of each treatment appeal to particular patients and how best to disseminate them.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emotional disorders are highly prevalent in primary care. We aimed to determine whether a transdiagnostic psychological therapy plus treatment‐as‐usual (TAU) is more efficacious than TAU alone in primary care adult patients. METHODS: A randomized, two‐arm, single‐blind clinical trial was conducted in 22 primary care centres in Spain. A total of 1061 adult patients with emotional disorders were enrolled. The transdiagnostic protocol (n = 527) consisted of seven 90‐min sessions (8‐10 patients) delivered over a 12‐14‐week period. TAU (n = 534) consisted of regular consultations with a general practitioner. Primary outcome measures were self‐reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatizations. Secondary outcome measures were functioning and quality of life. Patients were assessed at baseline, post‐treatment, and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol analyses were performed. RESULTS: Post‐treatment primary outcomes were significantly better in the transdiagnostic group compared to TAU (anxiety: p < 0.001; Morris's d = ‐0.65; depression: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.58, and somatic symptoms: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.40). These effects were sustained at the 12‐month follow‐up (anxiety: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.44; depression: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.36 and somatic symptoms: p < 0.001; d = ‐0.32). The transdiagnostic group also had significantly better outcomes on functioning (d = 0.16‐0.33) and quality of life domains (d = 0.24‐0.42), with sustained improvement at the 12‐month follow‐up in functioning (d = 0.25‐0.39) and quality of life (d = 0.58‐0.72). Reliable recovery rates showed large between‐group effect sizes (d > 0.80) in favour of the transdiagnostic group after treatment and at the 12‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a brief transdiagnostic psychological intervention to TAU may significantly improve outcomes in emotional disorders treated in primary care.

abstract = {Objective Group reading activities are often reported to be helpful in a variety of psychiatric conditions. However, data on the effects of structured reading rehabilitation activities, in both hospital and community settings for patients with psychosis, are still scarce. Our aim was to investigate the effects on clinical status, disability, psychosocial functioning and cognitive functioning of a structured group reading activity, in a sample of hospitalized patients with psychosis. Methods We enrolled 41 consecutive patients with psychosis and randomly assigned them to a structured group reading programme. For all included patients, we psychometrically evaluated clinical symptomatology, psychosocial functioning and disability, as well as cognitive functioning. All evaluations were repeated at a 6-month follow-up. Repeated-measure multiple analyses of variance were used to test the effect of the group reading activities on the clinical, psychosocial and cognitive measures. Results We found that, after 6?months from discharge, structured group reading activities induced a statistically significant improvement of cognitive (p?<?0.007) and psychosocial (p?<?0.008) functioning in patients with psychosis and reduced their disability (p?<?0.005), with respect to the control group. Furthermore, such programmes are easy to implement and were perceived as extremely ?interesting? and ?useful? by patients with psychosis. Conclusions Rehabilitation programmes focusing on group reading activities should be regarded as a valid psychosocial rehabilitation tool for psychotic patients with severe mental disability.

abstract = {Abstract It is common practice in both randomized and quasi-experiments to adjust for baseline characteristics when estimating the average effect of an intervention. The inclusion of a pre-test, for example, can reduce both the standard error of this estimate and?in non-randomized designs?its bias. At the same time, it is also standard to report the effect of an intervention in standardized effect size units, thereby making it comparable to other interventions and studies. Curiously, the estimation of this effect size, including covariate adjustment, has received little attention. In this article, we provide a framework for defining effect sizes in designs with a pre-test (e.g., difference-in-differences and analysis of covariance) and propose estimators of those effect sizes. The estimators and approximations to their sampling distributions are evaluated using a simulation study and then demonstrated using an example from published data.},

abstract = {This study examines community integration among homeless adults with mental illness 6 and 12 months after random assignment to Housing First (independent apartments or congregate residence) with support services or to treatment as usual (TAU). Residence in independent apartments was associated with increased 'psychological integration' for participants with less severe needs; however, no significant improvement in 'physical integration' was observed among any of the intervention groups. Analysis of individual items on the Psychological Integration subscale revealed that, compared to TAU, participants assigned to independent apartments were more likely to endorse statements related to the emotional components of community but not statements related to neighboring. Participants assigned to the congregate residence were more likely to endorse knowing their neighbors, but not interacting with neighbors or the emotional components of community. Findings are discussed in terms of housing program as well as broader contextual factors.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.Arch Intern Med. 2006;166:1092-1097-->},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled study of 164 outpatients with bipolar disorder in a community mental health center who received standardized psychoeducation (Life Goals Program [LGP]) or treatment as usual sought to determine whether there were differences between the groups in medication adherence attitudes and behaviors. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (N=80) or treatment as usual plus LGP (N=84) and were assessed at baseline and at the three‐, six‐, and 12‐month follow‐up. Primary outcomes were change in score from baseline on the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) and on self‐reported treatment adherence behaviors (SRTAB). RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences between the two groups. Slightly less than half (N=41, 49%) of the LGP group participated in most or all (four to six) LGP sessions, 14% (N=12) participated in one to three sessions, and 37% (N=31) did not participate in any sessions. At the 12‐month follow‐up there was improvement among all patients, with no significant differences between the two groups, in DAI scores, SRTAB, symptoms, psychopathology, and functional status. Greater depressive severity at baseline was associated with more negative attitudes toward treatment over time, although this finding was not significant (p=.056). Secondary analysis of persons in the LGP group found that compared with those who did not go to any LGP sessions, those with partial or full participation in LGP sessions had improved attitudes toward medication at the three‐ and six‐month follow‐up, but no difference was found between the three LGP subgroups by the 12‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between two groups in treatment attitudes at the 12‐month follow‐up. Low attendance rates mitigated effects on primary outcomes. Effects of LGP may become lost over time without ongoing intervention, and individuals with depression may have reduced response to LGP.},

To address these objectives, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of 63 participants, randomized 1:1 into CBSST or Treatment-As-Usual (TAU). The setting was a community-based geriatric mental health outpatient clinic in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Data were collected at baseline, and week 18, 36 and 52, between June 2008 and May 2014. Participants were outpatients, aged 60 or older, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and no evidence of dementia or other conditions associated with cognitive or functional impairment. The intervention was a weekly group CBSST for 36 weeks. Cognition, including executive function, was assessed at baseline. Modified total score on the Independent Living Skills Survey (ILSS) at 18, 36, and 52 weeks was the primary outcome measure. In a linear mixed model analysis, the ILSS trajectory was better in the CBSST group than the TAU group, with significantly better function at 36 (Cohen's d = 0.75) and 52 weeks (Cohen's d = 0.92). Baseline executive dysfunction moderated CBSST response, whereby participants with more severe executive dysfunction experienced the most improvement in ILSS.

abstract = {We designed and pilot-tested a group-based, w ork-related c ognitive- b ehavioral t herapy (WCBT) for unemployed individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). WCBT, delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service professionals, aims to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, obtain, and retain employment. We compared WCBT to a v ocational s ervices a s u sual control condition (VSAU). Participants were unemployed, homeless, largely African American, vocational service-seeking adults with SAD ( N = 58), randomized to receive either eight sessions of WCBT plus VSAU or VSAU alone and followed three months post-treatment. Multilevel modeling revealed significantly greater reductions in social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and functional impairment for WCBT compared to VSAU. Coefficients for job search activity and self-efficacy indicated greater increases for WCBT. Hours worked per week in the follow-up period did not differ between the groups, but small sample size and challenges associated with measuring work hours may have contributed to this finding. Overall, the results of this study suggest that unemployed persons with SAD can be effectively treated with specialized work-related CBT administered by vocational service professionals. Future testing of WCBT with a larger sample, a longer follow-up period, and adequate power to assess employment outcomes is warranted.

abstract = {A pilot study of a brief group‐based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention (12 two‐hour sessions) was conducted with clients of public mental health services meeting four or more criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Participants were randomly assigned to receive the ACT group intervention in addition to their current treatment (ACT + TAU; N= 21) or to continue with treatment as usual alone (TAU; N= 20). There was significantly more improvement from baseline for the ACT + TAU condition than the TAU condition on the primary outcome variable‐self‐rated BPD symptoms. The ACT + TAU gain was both clinically and statistically significant. The ACT + TAU condition also had significantly more positive change on anxiety and hopelessness, and on the following ACT consistent process variables: psychological flexibility, emotion regulation skills, mindfulness, and fear of emotions. For all but anxiety, the improvements for the ACT + TAU condition were significant, while the TAU condition had no significant changes on any measure. Follow‐up was possible for only a small number of participants. The improvements gained by the ACT + TAU participants were maintained except for fear of emotions. Anxiety continued to improve, becoming significantly different from baseline at follow‐up. Examination of mediators found that psychological flexibility, emotion regulation skills and mindfulness, but not less fear of emotions, mediated BPD symptoms. Psychological flexibility and emotion regulation skills also mediated hopelessness. There is a need for a larger trial, for comparison with other established treatments for BPD, and for conducting a trial of a longer intervention. Nonetheless, this pilot study suggests that a brief group‐based ACT intervention may be a valuable addition to TAU for people with BPD symptoms in the public sector. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a disabling illness. Social cognition and interaction training (SCIT) seeks to improve patients' social functioning by alleviating deficits in social cognition. SCIT has shown promise in improving social cognition in patients with schizophrenia, but has not yet been studied in Japan. Design: An assessor-masked, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted to compare the feasibility and efficacy of SCIT with treatment as usual (TAU). Setting: Participants were recruited from outpatient clinics at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry and four other hospitals in Japan. Participants: Seventy-two patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder consented to participate in the trial. Procedure: Participants were randomly allocated to either a SCIT subgroup or a TAU subgroup. SCIT is a manual-based group intervention that is delivered in 20-24-h-long weekly sessions. Groups include two to three clinicians and four to eight patients. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that SCIT would be found to be feasible and that patients who were randomized to receive SCIT would exhibit improvements in social cognition. Results: Data from 32 participants in each subgroup were entered into analyses. The persistence rate in the SCIT subgroup was 88.9%, and the average attendance rate was 87.0%. Intrinsic motivation was significantly higher in the SCIT subgroup than the TAU group during the first half of the program. Mixed effects modeling of various outcome measures revealed no significant interaction between measurement timepoint and group any measures, including social cognition, neurocognition, symptom severity, and social functioning. In the case of the social cognition measure, significant change was observed only in the SCIT subgroup; however, the interaction between timepoint and group failed to reach significance. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, a shorter duration of illness was found to be associated with significantly better improvement on the social cognition measure in the SCIT subgroup compared with the TAU subgroup. Conclusions: In terms of the primary objective, the relatively low dropout rate observed in the present study suggests that SCIT is feasible and well tolerated by patients with schizophrenia in Japan. This view is also supported by participants' relatively high attendance and intrinsic motivation.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Although the importance of recovery-oriented care for people with severe mental illness (SMI) is widely acknowledged, essential elements such as personalization and involvement of significant others are not adequately implemented in practice. OBJECTIVE To determine whether using resource groups (RGs) within flexible assertive community treatment (FACT) has favorable effects on empowerment and recovery-related outcomes in people with SMI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This assessor-blind, multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 1, 2017, to September 30, 2020, with follow-up at 9 and 18 months. A total of 158 participants aged 18 to 65 years meeting the criteria for SMI were randomly allocated to FACT plus RG vs FACT as usual (1:1) in 20 FACT teams throughout the Netherlands. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The study was prespecified in the trial protocol and data from the intent-to-treat population were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS In the FACT plus RG condition, patients chose members from their informal and formal networks to form an RG that meets quarterly to discuss self-formulated recovery goals. The RG was integrated into the multidisciplinary support provided by the FACT team. In the FACT as-usual condition, empowerment (defined as overcoming powerlessness and gaining control of one's life) and involvement of significant others was also part of the provided care, but without the structure of the RG. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported empowerment, measured with the Netherlands Empowerment List. RESULTS A total of 158 participants with SMI (median age, 38 [median absolute deviation, 13] years; 93 men [58.9%]) were randomized to FACT plus RG (n = 80) or FACT as usual (n = 78) care. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that randomization to the RG condition was associated with a clinically significant increase in empowerment (Cohen d, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.21-0.86) and improved outcomes with small to medium effect sizes in terms of quality of life (Cohen d, 0.25; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.56), personal recovery (Cohen d, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.06-0.69), quality of social contact (Cohen d, 0.24; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.56), disability (Cohen d, 0.29; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.60), general functioning (Cohen d, 0.30; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.62), and social functioning (Cohen d, 0.28; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.59). No differences between conditions were found regarding psychopathological symptoms, attachment, frequency of social contact, and employment. Compared with FACT as usual, participants who stayed with the assigned treatment in the RG condition were more satisfied with treatment at 9 (Cohen d = 0.45; t(135) = -2.62; P = .009) and 18 (Cohen d = 0.41; t(116) = -2.22; P = .02) months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings show that working with RGs improves empowerment and other mental health outcomes in people with SMI who receive community-based mental health services. This method of network-oriented care empowers people with SMI within their own environment.},

Until now, few techniques have been developed to specifically address low self-esteem in BPD. We developed a 6-session psychoeducative group therapy module to treat low self-esteem in BPD patients. After developing and piloting the therapy module, a controlled outpatient pilot study was performed. Nineteen female BPD patients participated in the group module after discharge from an inpatient DBT program. Twenty-four female BPD patients served as controls. Outcome was assessed by different self-esteem measures. Results showed a greater improvement in self-esteem in the intervention group. The findings suggest that the therapy module is an effective adjunctive treatment in increasing self-esteem in BPD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {The facilitation of relationships between group members who are engaged with one another should create models of social interactions. It appears then that a process-focused approach to social skills training would enhance the effectiveness of current cognitive-behavioral social skills training models inasmuch as the therapeutic group itself provides individuals with an opportunity to apply the skills learned in training with numerous social situations. This orientation to social skills training may provide an environment in which group members are more likely to enhance social competence as a function and outcome of group therapeutic process factors (such as altruism, affiliation, and universality). A preliminary study of the relative effectiveness of a traditional cognitive-behavioral approach to social skills training (SST) as compared to a combined cognitive-behavioral and process-oriented training format known as interactive behavioral training (IBT) was undertaken at a Community Residential Program for people with mental illness. Pre- and post-test mean scores on clinical rating scales do not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the treatment effects of IBT compared to standard SST. However, positive results on measures of psychiatric symptoms and social functioning, as well as clinical observations, provide encouragement for further examination of this promising model.},

abstract = {Due to the symptom diversity and pervasive function impairments (e.g. in perception, cognition, language, affect, behavior, daily and social functioning and sense of self), recurrent relapses, elevated disability, high rates of (co)morbidity, heightened premature mortality and high burden of care of psychotic disorders, psychosocial interventions are part of patients' standard care. There is growing evidence on the relevance of self-efficacy for well-being and functioning among these patients, but specific coping with stress self-efficacy has rarely been investigated. This study explored the outcomes of an intervention for the improvement of coping resources based on training in coping skills and coping with stress self-efficacy. Fourteen adult volunteers with schizophrenia (n = 12) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 2) were matched in clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and randomly assigned to the study groups. The intervention group received the training—with 15 twice per week sessions (8 weeks)—along with their pharmacological therapy; the control group received their prescribed drug therapy. Participants completed self-reports on coping with stress self-efficacy, perceived successful daily functioning based on coping skills and clinical status (Expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale). Trained patients showed a significant increase in coping with stress self-efficacy and reported greater successful functioning status, and significant improvements in their clinical status were also observed. All these enhancements remained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The intervention condition interacted with coping with stress self-efficacy and perceived coping functioning in explaining improvements in clinical status: in the treatment group, greater coping with stress self-efficacy translated into enhanced daily functioning, and this improvement predicted better clinical status. These findings stress the relevance of promoting coping resources in psychotic disorders and provide preliminary evidence for the potential benefits of coping with stress self-efficacy.

abstract = {Objective: Supported employment has experienced immense growth as an evidence-based intervention targeting the disproportionately high rates of unemployment among individuals with psychiatric disabilities who actively want to work. However, employment services are often not available to individuals who are ambivalent about work or lack work self-efficacy. The purpose of this study was to pilot-test the efficacy of a new peer-run photography-based group intervention (Vocational Empowerment Photovoice [VEP]) designed to empower individuals with psychiatric disabilities to consider employment services and pursue work. Method: A total of 51 individuals with serious mental illnesses enrolled at a university-based recovery center, who were not employed or enrolled in any vocational services, were randomly assigned to the VEP program or to a wait-list control group. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the impact of the VEP program on both extrinsic (enrollment in employment services and employment rates) and intrinsic (work hope, motivation and self-efficacy, vocational identity, overall empowerment and internalized stigma) work-related outcomes. Results: Participation in the VEP program was associated with a significantly higher rate of engagement in employment services over the course of the intervention and with significantly higher overall empowerment and decrease of internalized stigma sustained through the 3-month follow-up assessment. Stronger engagement in the VEP program was associated with increased work hope, self-efficacy and sense of vocational identity. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The study highlights the malleable nature of defeatist beliefs which prevent many individuals with mental illnesses from pursuing employment services despite their inherent interest in working.

abstract = {This study evaluated the psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial problems, and treatment response of personality-disordered substance abusers receiving services within a homeless drop-in center. Fifty-two homeless clients were assessed after program admission and randomly assigned to receive either individual psychotherapy focused on personality disorder and substance abuse relapse prevention (dual-focus schema therapy [DFST]) or standard group substance abuse counseling (SAC). Client functioning was assessed using measures of personality disorder, psychiatric symptoms, early maladaptive schemas, interpersonal problems, and addiction-related psychosocial impairment. Therapy retention (total weeks in treatment) and utilization (number of weeks in which sessions were attended) were the primary outcomes. Although rates of cluster B personality disorders were comparable to other substance dependent samples, clusters A and C disorders were disproportionately more common. Clients reported significant psychiatric symptoms, criminality, and psychosocial impairment, yet made limited lifetime use of mental health services. Overall, there was greater utilization of individual DFST than group SAC. However, clients with more severe personality disorder symptoms demonstrated better utilization of SAC than DFST.

abstract = {Some experimental designs involve clustering within only one treatment group. Such designs may involve group tutoring, therapy administered by multiple therapists, or interventions administered by clinics for the treatment group, whereas the control group receives no treatment. In such cases, the data analysis often proceeds as if there were no clustering within the treatment group. A consequence is that the actual significance level of the treatment effects is larger (i.e., actual p values are larger) than nominal. Additionally, biases will be introduced in estimates of the effect sizes and their variances, leading to inflated effects and underestimated variances when clustering in the treatment group is not taken into account. These consequences of clustering can seriously compromise the interpretation of study results. This article shows how information on the intraclass correlation can be used to obtain a correction for biases in the effect sizes and their variances, and also to obtain an adjustment to the significance test for the effects of clustering.},

abstract = {The authors' goal was to pilot test a newly developed manual-based group psychotherapy, called Integrated Group Therapy (IGT), for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence. In this open trial, patients (mean age 36.2 yrs) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) bipolar disorder and substance dependence (N = 45) were recruited in sequential blocks to receive either group therapy (N = 21) or 6 monthly assessments, but no experimental treatment (N = 24). When compared with patients who did not receive group therapy, patients who received IGT had significantly better outcomes on the Addiction Severity Index drug composite score (p < .03), percentage of months abstinent (p < .01), and likelihood of achieving 2 (p < .002) or 3 (p < .004) consecutive abstinent months. IGT is a promising treatment for patients with bipolar disorder and substance dependence, who have traditionally had poor outcomes. It is unclear, however, how much of the improvement among the group therapy patients is attributable to the specific content of the treatment. A study comparing this treatment with another active psychotherapy treatment is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Seventy‐nine subjects received treatment. Analyses at 12‐ and 24‐month follow‐ups on 84% of the treated subjects (N = 66), demonstrated no statistically significant differences in outcome on the major dependent variables. Outpatient referrals to the study complied with the treatments at twice the rate of inpatient referrals. The total study cohort showed significant improvements on all major outcomes at follow‐up.

abstract = {Objective:Individuals with serious mental illnesses have high rates of general medical comorbidity and challenges in managing these conditions. A growing workforce of certified peer specialists is available to help these individuals more effectively manage their health and health care. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of peer-led programs for self-management of general medical conditions for this population.Methods:This randomized study enrolled 400 participants with a serious mental illness and one or more chronic general medical conditions across three community mental health clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to the Health and Recovery Peer (HARP) program, a self-management program for general medical conditions led by certified peer specialists (N=198), or to usual care (N=202). Assessments were conducted at baseline and three and six months.Results:At six months, participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significant differential improvement in the primary study outcome, health-related quality of life. Specifically, compared with the usual care group, intervention participants had greater improvement in the Short-Form Health Survey physical component summary (an increase of 2.7 versus 1.4 points, p=.046) and mental component summary (4.6 versus 2.5 points, p=.039). Significantly greater six-month improvements in mental health recovery were seen for the intervention group (p=.02), but no other between-group differences in secondary outcome measures were significant.Conclusions:The HARP program was associated with improved physical health? and mental health?related quality of life among individuals with serious mental illness and comorbid general medical conditions, suggesting the potential benefits of more widespread dissemination of peer-led disease self-management in this population.},

abstract = {Although social cognitive impairments are evident in patients with schizophrenia across many cultures, psychosocial interventions are less used in Eastern countries. Despite a growing emphasis on community care in mental health services in Eastern countries, the synergistic effects of social cognitive intervention strategies on routine community mental health services are not well documented. This study aimed to adapt a group-based social cognitive skills training (SCST) program for use in a Korean context and evaluate its feasibility and preliminary effects among community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia. Forty-seven patients were assigned to either the SCST + treatment as usual (TAU) group (n = 21) or the TAU only group (n = 24). Participants completed tasks to assess social cognition, social functioning, neurocognition, and psychiatric symptoms before and after treatment. Over a period of approximately 12 weeks, drop-out rates were comparably low in both groups, and the attendance rates for the SCST program were high (85.7 %, mean sessions attended = 20.56/24 sessions). The SCST + TAU group demonstrated significant improvements in facial affect recognition, social functioning, and psychiatric symptoms compared to the TAU only group. A non-significant trend in theory of mind was observed, along with no improvements in social perception and neurocognition. The adapted version of the SCST program is feasible for implementation and demonstrates promise for enhancing social cognition and functioning in Korean outpatients with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of a theory‐driven multicomponent positive psychology intervention to improve well‐being for individuals with severe psychiatric conditions (SPCs) in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU). This intervention moves away from the traditional psychiatric perspectives that focused on symptoms and deficits, promoting a broader view of outcomes such as noncritical self‐acceptance, strengths, and positive relationships with others, among other things. METHOD: A two‐arm randomized and outcome‐blinded trial with pre‐post and 6‐month follow‐up evaluations was conducted to assess the intervention. A total of 141 participants were allocated to either the experimental condition or the waiting list group receiving their TAU. A mixed‐effect model was used to examine the efficacy of the intervention and a repeated‐measures Student's t‐test for the follow‐up effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: The intervention protocol was highly acceptable for participants, showing very high participant satisfaction as well as good attendance and adherence rates. At the end of the group therapy, participants reported a significant improvement in self‐acceptance and environmental mastery and, these changes were maintained in the follow‐up assessment after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this randomized control trial provide further evidence supporting that positive psychology approaches can be a powerful complementary strategy to promote more comprehensive psychiatric rehabilitation services for people with SPCs.
